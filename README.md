# 🐳 Dockerization Lab

**Dockerization Lab** is an educational repository designed to teach you how to containerize your applications using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, step by step.  
It starts with the fundamentals, introduces Docker Compose, and then applies everything to a real-world **NestJS + PostgreSQL** project.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand what Docker is and how it works  
- Learn about images, containers, volumes, and networks  
- Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications  
- Apply Dockerization principles to a NestJS backend project  
- Build a reusable structure for future apps
